As of my last update, the most recent comprehensive market data for apixaban might not be available for 2024-2025 specifically. However, I can provide an analysis based on previous trends and the competitive landscape known up to 2023. Please be aware that market share figures are often estimates and can vary based on the source. Typically, apixaban is marketed under the brand name Eliquis by Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, and its main competitors include other direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and emerging generics.

Here's a potential competitive landscape table populating these sections with known and predictive insights based on historical trends:

| Competitor                    | Brand       | Dosage Form | Market Share (%) |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer   | Eliquis     | Oral        | ~40-45%          |
| Johnson & Johnson/Bayer       | Xarelto     | Oral        | ~30-35%          |
| Boehringer Ingelheim          | Pradaxa     | Oral        | ~10-15%          |
| Daiichi Sankyo                | Savaysa/Lixiana | Oral   | ~5-10%           |
| Major Generic Manufacturers   | -           | Oral        | ~5-10%           |

### Additional Notes:
1. **Eliquis**: It is one of the leading DOACs globally and enjoys strong market leadership due to its favorable safety and efficacy profile.
   
2. **Xarelto and Pradaxa**: These brands continue to hold significant portions of the market, but Eliquis has been more aggressively capturing market share over the years.

3. **Savaysa/Lixiana**: While less dominant, they still maintain a niche presence in certain markets.

4. **Generics**: The introduction of generic apixaban is expected to slightly alter market dynamics, but branded Eliquis tends to maintain its market strength due to brand trust and established safety records.

Here is a general outline of the competitive landscape, focusing on North American and European companies:

| Competitor                | Brand        | Dosage Form    | Market Share (%) |

### Notes:

3. **Boehringer Ingelheim (Pradaxa)**: Pradaxa, while still relevant, has a smaller market share compared to Eliquis and Xarelto, around 10% in 2023. Its position may remain stable unless significant new data or competitive pricing changes occur.

| Competitor               | Brand    | Dosage Form       | Market Share (%)        |
|-------------------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Bristol-Myers Squibb / Pfizer | Eliquis  | Oral tablets      | ~32.56% in North America (2024); ~34.1% in North America (2024 estimate) |
| Generic manufacturers (various, post-patent expiry) | Generic Apixaban | Oral tablets      | Growing share post-2024 due to patent expiry; specific % not publicly detailed but significant price erosion expected post-2025 |
| Other branded/generic competitors | -        | -                 | No major branded competitors for apixaban; market dominated by Eliquis and generics |

**Details:**

- **Eliquis (apixaban)**, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, is the dominant branded product in North America and Europe. It held approximately **32.56% of the global apixaban market share in North America in 2024** and is the leading anticoagulant in this segment[4][6]. North America is the largest regional market, driven by advanced healthcare infrastructure and high cardiovascular disease prevalence[1][2].

- The **European market** also has strong uptake of Eliquis, supported by favorable reimbursement policies and high awareness, though exact market share percentages specific to Europe are not explicitly detailed in the sources. Europe is the second-largest market after North America[1][2].

- **Generic apixaban** is increasingly entering the market due to patent expirations expected around 2024-2025, leading to growing generic market share and price erosion of branded Eliquis[4]. However, precise market share percentages for generics in North America and Europe for 2024-2025 are not publicly available but are expected to increase significantly post-2024.

- No other major branded competitors for apixaban exist; the market is largely a duopoly of **Eliquis (branded)** and **generic apixaban** products.

**Summary:**
