# Epic 2: Multi-API Integration & Data Collection Pipeline

**Epic Goal:** Implement data persistence foundation and comprehensive multi-API coordination across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, and Tavily with temperature variation, source prioritization, and complete 4-stage pipeline orchestration. This epic delivers the core pharmaceutical intelligence gathering capability with full audit trail integration.

### Story 2.1: Multi-API Service Integration Framework

As a **Data Engineer**,
I want **to integrate multiple search APIs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, Tavily) with configurable activation and audit tracking**,
so that **the system can gather comprehensive pharmaceutical data from diverse sources with cost optimization and regulatory compliance**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. API integration service supporting all 5 search APIs with standardized request/response interfaces
2. Configuration system allowing enable/disable of individual APIs per request or globally through category configuration
3. API key management with secure storage, rotation capabilities, and audit logging for all integrated services
4. Rate limiting and quota management for each API with pharmaceutical cost optimization
5. Timeout handling and graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
6. Cost tracking with detailed audit trail: API costs per request, per category, per pharmaceutical compound analysis
7. Response standardization layer converting all API responses to common internal format with source attribution

### Story 2.2: Raw Data Collection & Persistence

As a **Data Scientist**,
I want **comprehensive data persistence foundation storing all API responses with complete pharmaceutical compliance metadata**,
so that **pharmaceutical intelligence can be re-analyzed, verified, and audited without repeating expensive API calls while meeting regulatory requirements**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Raw data storage tables capturing complete API responses with structured metadata and audit trail integration
2. Data persistence integrated with processId lineage tracking from Epic 1.2
3. Metadata capture including: API source, timestamp, cost, query parameters, response time, pharmaceutical compound, category
4. Pharmaceutical compliance data retention policies (7+ years) with archival and retrieval capabilities
5. Data integrity validation ensuring no data loss during high-volume concurrent processing
6. Search and retrieval capabilities for historical raw data analysis and regulatory audit support
7. Privacy and security controls for pharmaceutical data handling with encryption at rest and in transit

### Story 2.3: Temperature Variation & Search Strategy

As a **Pharmaceutical Analyst**,
I want **multi-temperature search execution per API (0.1, 0.5, 0.9+) with complete audit tracking of search strategies**,
so that **I can obtain comprehensive pharmaceutical intelligence coverage while maintaining transparency for regulatory compliance**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Temperature configuration system supporting dynamic temperature arrays per API with audit logging
2. Parallel execution of multiple temperature searches leveraging data persistence from Story 2.2
3. Temperature result correlation and tagging linked to processId tracking for pharmaceutical audit trails
4. Performance optimization preventing unnecessary duplicate API calls using persisted data
5. Temperature strategy configuration allowing category-specific temperature profiles from Epic 1.3
6. Results metadata including temperature used, API source, execution time, cost attribution, and pharmaceutical relevance scoring
7. Temperature effectiveness analytics supporting pharmaceutical intelligence optimization

### Story 2.4: Source Priority Implementation & Hierarchical Processing

As a **Regulatory Affairs Specialist**,
I want **hierarchical source prioritization (Paid APIs → .gov → Peer-reviewed → Industry → Company → News) with complete audit compliance**,
so that **pharmaceutical intelligence gathering emphasizes authoritative sources first while maintaining regulatory transparency**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Source classification system automatically identifying source types from URLs and content patterns
2. Hierarchical search execution with higher priority sources processed before lower priority sources
3. Source priority scoring algorithm with configurable weights per category using Epic 1.3 configuration
4. Early termination logic when high-priority sources provide sufficient pharmaceutical coverage
5. Source attribution metadata integrated with audit trail system from Epic 1.2
6. Category-specific source priority overrides leveraging basic category system from Epic 1.3
7. Source reliability scoring with pharmaceutical industry standards and historical accuracy tracking

### Story 2.5: Pipeline Orchestration & Stage Management

As a **System Architect**,
I want **robust pipeline orchestration managing the 4-stage process (Collection → Verification → Merging → Summary) with comprehensive audit integration**,
so that **pharmaceutical intelligence processing flows reliably through all stages with complete regulatory compliance and failure recovery**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Pipeline orchestration service coordinating all 4 stages with processId integration from Epic 1.2
2. Message queue system (RabbitMQ) handling stage transitions with audit trail logging
3. Stage completion detection and automatic progression leveraging data persistence from Story 2.2
4. Failure handling with stage-specific retry logic and audit trail documentation
5. Complete stage audit trail: stage entry/exit times, data volumes processed, errors encountered, recovery actions
6. Stage performance monitoring with bottleneck identification for pharmaceutical operational optimization
7. Dead letter queue handling with pharmaceutical compliance documentation for failed requests

### Story 2.6: Collection Status Reporting & Monitoring

As a **Pharmaceutical Research Director**,
I want **real-time visibility into data collection progress with comprehensive audit reporting**,
so that **I can assess pharmaceutical intelligence gathering comprehensiveness and maintain regulatory compliance transparency**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Collection progress API endpoint showing per-category data gathering status with audit trail integration
2. Source coverage reporting indicating which source types contributed data for each pharmaceutical category
3. Real-time collection metrics integrated with monitoring from Epic 1.6: APIs queried, sources found, data volume, costs
4. Quality indicators: source priority distribution, temperature variation coverage, duplicate detection with audit trails
5. Alert system for collection failures, quota exhaustion, or quality threshold violations
6. Collection completion notifications enabling downstream processing with audit trail linkage
7. Historical collection performance tracking supporting pharmaceutical operational optimization and compliance reporting
