3. Domain whitelist and blacklist management for pharmaceutical industry trusted and blocked sources
4. Publication date extraction and recency scoring with pharmaceutical industry relevance weighting
5. Author and publication credibility assessment for medical and regulatory content with audit trail
6. Source verification status tracking integrated with processId system: verified, unverified, flagged, blocked with reasoning
7. Verification confidence scoring providing data quality indicators for downstream pharmaceutical processing

### Story 3.2: Data Conflict Detection & Resolution

As a **Pharmaceutical Analyst**,
I want **intelligent conflict detection and resolution with complete decision audit trails**,
so that **final pharmaceutical intelligence reports present accurate, authoritative information with regulatory compliance documentation**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Conflict detection algorithms identifying contradictory data points across sources within pharmaceutical categories
2. Weighted conflict resolution using source hierarchy from Story 3.1 with configurable override capabilities
3. Threshold-based consensus building requiring multiple source confirmation with audit trail documentation
4. Conflict documentation and flagging for manual review integrated with processId tracking
5. Statistical analysis of confidence intervals for numerical pharmaceutical data with regulatory compliance scoring
6. Expert review workflow integration for complex pharmaceutical conflicts with audit trail maintenance
7. Complete conflict resolution audit trail: sources compared, resolution algorithm used, confidence scores, final decisions

### Story 3.3: Data Validation & Quality Assurance

As a **Regulatory Affairs Specialist**,
I want **comprehensive pharmaceutical data validation with regulatory compliance documentation**,
so that **intelligence reports meet pharmaceutical regulatory standards and support audit requirements with complete transparency**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Data completeness validation checking required fields per pharmaceutical category with audit trail integration
2. Format standardization ensuring consistent pharmaceutical data representation across all sources
3. Pharmaceutical-specific validation rules: patent numbers, regulatory identifiers, clinical trial registrations with compliance documentation
4. Cross-reference validation confirming data consistency across related pharmaceutical databases with audit trails
5. Anomaly detection identifying statistical outliers in pharmaceutical data with regulatory compliance flagging
6. Validation rule configuration per category with audit trail of rule changes and applications
7. Comprehensive validation reporting with quality metrics and pharmaceutical regulatory compliance status

### Story 3.4: Validated Data Merging & Consolidation

As a **Data Scientist**,
I want **intelligent merging of validated data with comprehensive pharmaceutical audit compliance**,
so that **final outputs provide authoritative pharmaceutical intelligence with complete regulatory documentation**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Merging algorithms combining complementary data from multiple sources with audit trail of merge decisions
2. Data enrichment logic enhancing incomplete records with audit documentation of enhancement sources
3. Temporal data handling for historical pharmaceutical information with time-series audit compliance
4. Geographic data consolidation for global pharmaceutical markets with regulatory jurisdiction tracking
5. Confidence scoring for merged data indicating reliability with pharmaceutical regulatory compliance metrics
6. Complete merging audit trail documenting source contributions for every data element
7. Quality assurance validation ensuring merged pharmaceutical data maintains industry accuracy standards

### Story 3.5: Verification Reporting & Quality Metrics

As a **Pharmaceutical Research Director**,
I want **comprehensive verification reporting with pharmaceutical compliance metrics**,
so that **I can assess data reliability for strategic pharmaceutical decisions while maintaining regulatory audit compliance**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Verification summary reports with source coverage, conflict resolution outcomes, and pharmaceutical quality scores
2. Category-specific quality metrics indicating pharmaceutical intelligence completeness per analysis area
3. Source contribution analysis showing most valuable pharmaceutical data sources with audit trail integration
4. Data quality trends and improvement recommendations based on pharmaceutical verification processing history
5. Real-time verification status updates integrated with processId tracking for pharmaceutical operational monitoring
6. Quality threshold alerts when verification results fall below pharmaceutical decision-making standards
7. Comprehensive pharmaceutical compliance reporting supporting regulatory audit requirements and operational optimization
