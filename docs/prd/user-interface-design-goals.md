# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

**Enterprise API Management Interface**: Clean, data-focused administrative dashboard enabling pharmaceutical professionals to configure categories, monitor processing status, and review results. The interface prioritizes information density and operational efficiency over consumer-friendly design, reflecting the professional pharmaceutical audience who value comprehensive data access and system control.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Configuration-Driven Management**: Primary interactions focus on enabling/disabling categories, configuring source priorities, and adjusting API/temperature settings. Users expect database-driven configuration changes to take effect immediately without system restart.

**Process Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time status tracking for concurrent drug analyses with drill-down capabilities into individual processId lineage. Failure alerts and sub-process rerun capabilities provide operational control.

**Results Review Interface**: Structured display of 17-category pharmaceutical intelligence with JSON export capabilities and webhook delivery status confirmation.

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

- **Admin Configuration Panel** - Category enable/disable, source priority management, API key configuration
- **Request Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time processing status, concurrent request tracking, failure alerts
- **Process Lineage Viewer** - Detailed audit trail from requestID through all phases and sub-phases
- **Results Review Interface** - Display of completed 17-category analysis with export capabilities
- **System Health Monitoring** - API usage, cost tracking, performance metrics, webhook delivery status
- **User Management Console** - Enterprise user authentication, role-based access control

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Pharmaceutical professionals often work in regulated environments requiring accessibility compliance. WCAG AA standards ensure the interface meets enterprise accessibility requirements.

### Branding

**Pharmaceutical Industry Professional Aesthetic**: Clean, clinical interface design reflecting the precision and reliability expected in pharmaceutical operations. Color scheme emphasizes data clarity and operational status (green for healthy processes, amber for warnings, red for failures). Typography optimized for extended data review sessions common in pharmaceutical research workflows.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Web Responsive**: Primary access through desktop browsers for detailed configuration and monitoring, with responsive design supporting tablet access for executives reviewing results and mobile access for alerts and basic status monitoring.
