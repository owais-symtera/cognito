# Requirements

### Functional

**FR1:** The system SHALL accept API requests with requestID and drug name, returning immediate "Request submitted" acknowledgment within 2 seconds

**FR2:** The system SHALL process requests asynchronously through 4-stage pipeline (Data Collection → Verification → Merging → Summary Generation) and deliver results via webhook with original requestID

**FR3:** The system SHALL support 17 configurable categories (10 Phase 1 data collection + 7 Phase 2 decision intelligence) that can be dynamically enabled/disabled per request without code deployment

**FR4:** The system SHALL implement hierarchical source prioritization (Paid APIs → .gov → Peer-reviewed → Industry databases → Company websites → News/media) with category-specific source mapping

**FR5:** The system SHALL execute multi-API searches with configurable temperature variations (0.1, 0.5, 0.9+) across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, and Tavily APIs

**FR6:** The system SHALL perform authenticity verification using source hierarchy evaluation, assign verification scores, and filter invalid data before merging

**FR7:** The system SHALL resolve conflicting data using weighted algorithms based on source priority, with Paid APIs receiving 10x weight versus news sources

**FR8:** The system SHALL generate JSON-formatted output for all categories with standardized structure and mark missing data as "N/A" without approximations

**FR9:** The system SHALL provide processId lineage tracking linking all phases, sub-phases, API calls, and webhook deliveries to original requestID for complete audit trail

**FR10:** The system SHALL support concurrent processing of multiple drug analysis requests without interference or resource conflicts

**FR11:** The system SHALL store prompt templates, dynamic parameters, and category configurations in database for runtime modification without system restart

**FR12:** The system SHALL generate Phase 2 decision intelligence (scoring matrices, Go/No-Go verdicts, risk assessments, executive summaries) using configurable LLM processing and rule-based logic

**FR13:** The system SHALL provide admin dashboard with real-time failure alerts, sub-process rerun capability, and process status monitoring across all concurrent requests

**FR14:** The system SHALL support cost optimization through selective API activation based on data quality requirements and budget constraints

**FR15:** The system SHALL enable category-specific source priority overrides while maintaining default hierarchical prioritization

### Non Functional

**NFR1:** The system SHALL maintain 99.5% uptime to support pharmaceutical industry decision-making requirements

**NFR2:** The system SHALL process webhook delivery within 15 minutes of request submission for standard 17-category analysis

**NFR3:** The system SHALL scale to support minimum 100 concurrent drug analysis requests without performance degradation

**NFR4:** The system SHALL maintain data security compliant with pharmaceutical industry standards including encryption at rest and in transit

**NFR5:** The system SHALL provide API response times under 2 seconds for request acknowledgment and under 500ms for status queries

**NFR6:** The system SHALL maintain audit logs for minimum 7 years to support pharmaceutical regulatory compliance requirements

**NFR7:** The system SHALL implement failover mechanisms ensuring no data loss during processing pipeline failures

**NFR8:** The system SHALL optimize API costs by achieving target data coverage with minimal paid API usage through intelligent source selection

**NFR9:** The system SHALL provide webhook delivery reliability with retry mechanisms and delivery confirmation tracking

**NFR10:** The system SHALL support integration with enterprise systems through RESTful APIs and standard authentication mechanisms
