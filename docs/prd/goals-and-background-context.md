# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• **Deliver 85%+ pharmaceutical data coverage** for any drug compound through automated multi-source aggregation with hierarchical source prioritization (Paid APIs → .gov → Peer-reviewed → Industry DBs → Company sites → News)
• **Enable instant API responses** with background processing and webhook delivery for seamless enterprise workflow integration
• **Provide comprehensive 17-category pharmaceutical intelligence** covering market analysis, regulatory status, and strategic recommendations tailored to pharmaceutical professional workflows
• **Support dynamic configuration** allowing categories and source priorities to be enabled/disabled without code changes, with category-specific source mapping
• **Generate actionable Go/No-Go decisions** with weighted scoring and risk assessments that support pharmaceutical development pipeline decisions within hours instead of weeks
• **Establish enterprise-grade reliability** with processId lineage tracking for regulatory compliance and audit trail requirements
• **Create database-driven architecture** enabling flexible prompt management and parameter configuration with cost-optimized source selection

### Background Context

CognitoAI-Engine addresses the critical workflow challenges faced by pharmaceutical professionals who currently spend 2-3 weeks per compound manually gathering intelligence from fragmented sources. Research Directors like Dr. Sarah Chen coordinate multiple teams across government databases, patent offices, and market research firms - a process that delays pipeline decisions and reduces competitive responsiveness. Business Development Managers struggle with real-time competitive intelligence for partnership negotiations, while Regulatory Affairs Specialists manually track complex patent and exclusivity timelines across global markets.

The platform leverages advanced LLM technology with hierarchical source prioritization to automatically collect, verify, and synthesize pharmaceutical intelligence. The asynchronous processing architecture with webhook delivery integrates directly into existing CRM, ERP, and research database workflows, while the database-driven configuration provides unprecedented flexibility for pharmaceutical organizations to customize data collection. The processId lineage tracking ensures regulatory compliance and audit trail requirements are met, supporting the highly regulated pharmaceutical environment where decision documentation is critical.
