# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish foundational project infrastructure, database schemas with comprehensive audit trail foundation, basic category configuration system, API gateway, and essential monitoring capabilities. This epic provides the critical foundation for pharmaceutical intelligence processing while ensuring regulatory compliance and operational visibility from day one.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup & Infrastructure Foundation

As a **DevOps Engineer**,
I want **to establish the monorepo structure with CI/CD pipeline and basic microservices architecture**,
so that **the development team can build and deploy CognitoAI-Engine components reliably with pharmaceutical industry standards**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure created with separate service directories (api-gateway, pipeline-orchestration, webhook-delivery, admin-dashboard)
2. CI/CD pipeline configured with automated testing gates and deployment approval processes
3. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) templates for PostgreSQL, Redis, and core services
4. Basic Docker containerization for all microservices with health check endpoints
5. Environment configuration management (dev, staging, production) with secrets handling
6. Monitoring foundation (Prometheus, Grafana) deployed and collecting basic metrics

### Story 1.2: Database Schema, Core Data Models & Audit Foundation

As a **Backend Developer**,
I want **to implement comprehensive database schemas with complete audit trail foundation for pharmaceutical regulatory compliance**,
so that **all pharmaceutical intelligence processing maintains immutable audit records from the first data operation**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL schemas created for: requests, categories, process_tracking, audit_logs, user_management, raw_data_collection
2. ProcessId tracking table with foreign key relationships across ALL operational tables
3. Immutable audit logging system with triggers on ALL tables capturing: who, what, when, why for every data change
4. Audit trail lineage tracking linking every data modification back to original requestID and processId
5. Time-series tables (InfluxDB) configured for performance metrics and API usage tracking
6. Database migration system established with rollback capabilities
7. 7-year data retention policies implemented for pharmaceutical regulatory compliance

### Story 1.3: Basic Category Configuration System

As a **System Administrator**,
I want **basic category configuration framework supporting the 17 pharmaceutical categories with enable/disable capabilities**,
so that **pharmaceutical organizations can begin customizing intelligence gathering while advanced features are developed**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Category configuration table with: category_id, category_name, phase (1 or 2), enabled (boolean), basic_prompt_template
2. Default configuration for all 17 pharmaceutical categories with standard prompts
3. API endpoint for category enable/disable operations with immediate effect (no restart required)
4. Category dependency validation preventing disabling categories required by other enabled categories
5. Basic category configuration UI accessible through admin interface
6. Category configuration changes logged to audit trail with administrator identification
7. Configuration backup and restore functionality for pharmaceutical operational governance

### Story 1.4: API Gateway with Request Handling

As a **Pharmaceutical Research Director**,
I want **to submit drug analysis requests via API and receive immediate acknowledgment with complete audit tracking**,
so that **I can integrate CognitoAI-Engine with our existing research workflow systems while maintaining regulatory compliance**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. RESTful API endpoint POST /api/v1/analyze accepting requestID and drug_name parameters
2. Request validation ensuring required parameters are present and properly formatted for pharmaceutical compounds
3. Immediate response within 2 seconds returning "Request submitted" with system-generated processId
4. Request persistence with full audit trail: timestamp, requestID, processId, initial status, requesting user/system
5. Authentication framework supporting API keys and enterprise SSO integration with pharmaceutical systems
6. Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse and manage system load
7. API documentation generated automatically with OpenAPI/Swagger specification including pharmaceutical examples

### Story 1.5: Basic Process Tracking & Status API

As a **Business Development Manager**,
I want **to query the status of my submitted drug analysis requests with complete transparency**,
so that **I can provide accurate timelines to stakeholders and maintain audit compliance for pharmaceutical business processes**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. GET /api/v1/status/{processId} endpoint returning current processing stage and estimated completion
2. Process status tracking through states: submitted, collecting, verifying, merging, summarizing, completed, failed
3. All status changes logged to audit trail with timestamps and automated system reasoning
4. Error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes for invalid processId requests
5. Status response includes: processId, requestID, current_stage, progress_percentage, estimated_completion, error_details, audit_summary
6. Process history API showing complete status progression for pharmaceutical compliance reviews
7. Bulk status query support for monitoring multiple concurrent pharmaceutical analyses

### Story 1.6: Basic Health Checks & System Diagnostics

As a **System Administrator**,
I want **essential health monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for pharmaceutical operational requirements**,
so that **I can ensure system reliability and meet pharmaceutical uptime requirements with early issue detection**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Health check endpoints for all microservices returning: service status, dependency health, response times
2. Basic system diagnostic endpoint showing: active requests, processing queue depth, database connectivity
3. Automated alerting for critical system failures affecting pharmaceutical intelligence processing
4. Log aggregation system collecting structured logs from all services with pharmaceutical compliance formatting
5. Essential performance metrics: API response times, database query performance, memory usage
6. Service dependency health checking ensuring all required pharmaceutical processing components are operational
7. Basic monitoring dashboard accessible to pharmaceutical system administrators
