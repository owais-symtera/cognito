# CognitoAI-Engine Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• **Deliver 85%+ pharmaceutical data coverage** for any drug compound through automated multi-source aggregation with hierarchical source prioritization (Paid APIs → .gov → Peer-reviewed → Industry DBs → Company sites → News)
• **Enable instant API responses** with background processing and webhook delivery for seamless enterprise workflow integration
• **Provide comprehensive 17-category pharmaceutical intelligence** covering market analysis, regulatory status, and strategic recommendations tailored to pharmaceutical professional workflows
• **Support dynamic configuration** allowing categories and source priorities to be enabled/disabled without code changes, with category-specific source mapping
• **Generate actionable Go/No-Go decisions** with weighted scoring and risk assessments that support pharmaceutical development pipeline decisions within hours instead of weeks
• **Establish enterprise-grade reliability** with processId lineage tracking for regulatory compliance and audit trail requirements
• **Create database-driven architecture** enabling flexible prompt management and parameter configuration with cost-optimized source selection

### Background Context

CognitoAI-Engine addresses the critical workflow challenges faced by pharmaceutical professionals who currently spend 2-3 weeks per compound manually gathering intelligence from fragmented sources. Research Directors like Dr. Sarah Chen coordinate multiple teams across government databases, patent offices, and market research firms - a process that delays pipeline decisions and reduces competitive responsiveness. Business Development Managers struggle with real-time competitive intelligence for partnership negotiations, while Regulatory Affairs Specialists manually track complex patent and exclusivity timelines across global markets.

The platform leverages advanced LLM technology with hierarchical source prioritization to automatically collect, verify, and synthesize pharmaceutical intelligence. The asynchronous processing architecture with webhook delivery integrates directly into existing CRM, ERP, and research database workflows, while the database-driven configuration provides unprecedented flexibility for pharmaceutical organizations to customize data collection. The processId lineage tracking ensures regulatory compliance and audit trail requirements are met, supporting the highly regulated pharmaceutical environment where decision documentation is critical.

### Overall UX Vision

**Enterprise API Management Interface**: Clean, data-focused administrative dashboard enabling pharmaceutical professionals to configure categories, monitor processing status, and review results. The interface prioritizes information density and operational efficiency over consumer-friendly design, reflecting the professional pharmaceutical audience who value comprehensive data access and system control.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Configuration-Driven Management**: Primary interactions focus on enabling/disabling categories, configuring source priorities, and adjusting API/temperature settings. Users expect database-driven configuration changes to take effect immediately without system restart.

**Process Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time status tracking for concurrent drug analyses with drill-down capabilities into individual processId lineage. Failure alerts and sub-process rerun capabilities provide operational control.

**Results Review Interface**: Structured display of 17-category pharmaceutical intelligence with JSON export capabilities and webhook delivery status confirmation.

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

- **Admin Configuration Panel** - Category enable/disable, source priority management, API key configuration

- **Results Review Interface** - Display of completed 17-category analysis with export capabilities
- **System Health Monitoring** - API usage, cost tracking, performance metrics, webhook delivery status
- **User Management Console** - Enterprise user authentication, role-based access control

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Pharmaceutical professionals often work in regulated environments requiring accessibility compliance. WCAG AA standards ensure the interface meets enterprise accessibility requirements.

### Branding

**Pharmaceutical Industry Professional Aesthetic**: Clean, clinical interface design reflecting the precision and reliability expected in pharmaceutical operations. Color scheme emphasizes data clarity and operational status (green for healthy processes, amber for warnings, red for failures). Typography optimized for extended data review sessions common in pharmaceutical research workflows.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Web Responsive**: Primary access through desktop browsers for detailed configuration and monitoring, with responsive design supporting tablet access for executives reviewing results and mobile access for alerts and basic status monitoring.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Rationale:** A monorepo supports the tightly integrated multi-pipeline architecture with shared database schemas, common API interfaces, and cross-cutting concerns like processId tracking. The 17-category framework with shared validation and merging logic benefits from unified codebase management, while still allowing independent deployment of API services, webhook handlers, and admin interfaces.

### Service Architecture

**Microservices within Monorepo:** The system requires independent scaling of different components - API request handlers need high availability, while LLM processing services need compute optimization, and webhook delivery needs reliability guarantees. Key services include:

- **API Gateway Service** (request acceptance, immediate response)
- **Pipeline Orchestration Service** (4-stage Phase 1 coordination)
- **Multi-API Integration Service** (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, Tavily)
- **Verification & Merging Service** (source hierarchy, conflict resolution)
- **LLM Processing Service** (summary generation, Phase 2 decision intelligence)
- **Webhook Delivery Service** (reliable result delivery with retry)
- **Admin Dashboard Service** (configuration, monitoring, failure management)

### Testing Requirements

**Full Testing Pyramid:** Given pharmaceutical industry reliability requirements and regulatory compliance needs:

- **Unit Tests** for all business logic, especially source prioritization algorithms and data merging logic
- **Integration Tests** for multi-API coordination, database persistence, and webhook delivery
- **End-to-End Tests** for complete pipeline execution from API request through webhook delivery
- **Contract Tests** for external API integrations (paid APIs, search APIs)
- **Load Tests** for concurrent processing capabilities (100+ simultaneous requests)
- **Compliance Tests** for audit trail integrity and data retention requirements

**Manual Testing Convenience:** Pharmaceutical data accuracy requires human validation capabilities - test harnesses for reviewing AI-generated summaries, comparing source data conflicts, and validating Go/No-Go decision logic.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **API key rotation** capabilities for external service integrations

**Scalability Architecture:**
- **Horizontal pod autoscaling** for compute-intensive LLM processing
- **Message queues (RabbitMQ)** for reliable async processing coordination
- **CDN integration** for global webhook delivery optimization

**Development & Deployment:**
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing and deployment approval gates
- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** for consistent environment management
