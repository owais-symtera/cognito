# Story 2.4: Source Priority Implementation & Hierarchical Processing

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Regulatory Affairs Specialist,
**I want** hierarchical source prioritization (Paid APIs → .gov → Peer-reviewed → Industry → Company → News) with complete audit compliance,
**so that** pharmaceutical intelligence gathering emphasizes authoritative sources first while maintaining regulatory transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Source classification system automatically identifying source types from URLs and content patterns
2. Hierarchical search execution with higher priority sources processed before lower priority sources
3. Source priority scoring algorithm with configurable weights per category using Epic 1.3 configuration
4. Early termination logic when high-priority sources provide sufficient pharmaceutical coverage
5. Source attribution metadata integrated with audit trail system from Epic 1.2
6. Category-specific source priority overrides leveraging basic category system from Epic 1.3
7. Source reliability scoring with pharmaceutical industry standards and historical accuracy tracking

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build source classification system (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement hierarchical processing logic (AC: 2)
- [x] Create priority scoring algorithm (AC: 3)
- [x] Add early termination optimization (AC: 4)
- [x] Integrate source attribution with audit trails (AC: 5)
- [x] Configure category-specific overrides (AC: 6)
- [x] Build reliability scoring system (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on Stories 2.1-2.3 for API integration, data persistence, and temperature strategies.

### Source Priority Hierarchy
```python
class SourcePriority(IntEnum):
    PAID_APIS = 1          # ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.
    GOVERNMENT = 2         # .gov, .edu domains
    PEER_REVIEWED = 3      # Academic journals
    INDUSTRY = 4           # Professional associations
    COMPANY = 5            # Pharmaceutical companies
    NEWS = 6               # News and media
```

## Testing
Test hierarchical processing order, early termination logic, and source classification accuracy.
