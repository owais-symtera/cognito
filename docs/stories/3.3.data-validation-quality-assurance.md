# Story 3.3: Data Validation & Quality Assurance

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Regulatory Affairs Specialist,
**I want** comprehensive pharmaceutical data validation with regulatory compliance documentation,
**so that** intelligence reports meet pharmaceutical regulatory standards and support audit requirements with complete transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Data completeness validation checking required fields per pharmaceutical category with audit trail integration
2. Format standardization ensuring consistent pharmaceutical data representation across all sources
3. Pharmaceutical-specific validation rules: patent numbers, regulatory identifiers, clinical trial registrations with compliance documentation
4. Cross-reference validation confirming data consistency across related pharmaceutical databases with audit trails
5. Anomaly detection identifying statistical outliers in pharmaceutical data with regulatory compliance flagging
6. Validation rule configuration per category with audit trail of rule changes and applications
7. Comprehensive validation reporting with quality metrics and pharmaceutical regulatory compliance status

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build data completeness validation per pharmaceutical category (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement format standardization across sources (AC: 2)
- [x] Create pharmaceutical-specific validation rules (AC: 3)
- [x] Add cross-reference validation for data consistency (AC: 4)
- [x] Implement anomaly detection with compliance flagging (AC: 5)
- [x] Create validation rule configuration system (AC: 6)
- [x] Build comprehensive validation reporting (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on Epic 1 for category configuration and Epic 2 for multi-source data. Integrates with pharmaceutical regulatory compliance standards and audit trail requirements.

### Pharmaceutical Validation Rules
```python
class PharmaceuticalValidation:
    VALIDATION_RULES = {
        'patent_numbers': r'^[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{6,10}$',
        'ndc_numbers': r'^[0-9]{4,5}-[0-9]{3,4}-[0-9]{1,2}$',
        'clinical_trial_id': r'^NCT[0-9]{8}$'
    }
```

## Testing
Test validation rules against pharmaceutical data formats, anomaly detection accuracy, and regulatory compliance reporting completeness.
