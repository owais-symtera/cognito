        self.category_config = CategoryConfiguration()
        self.api_manager = APIConfigurationManager()
        self.audit_logger = AuditTrailLogger()

    def manage_configuration(user, config_changes):
        # Validate user permissions
        # Apply configuration changes
        # Log audit trail
        # Trigger approval workflow if needed
        return config_status, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test administrative interface functionality, user role management, configuration change workflows, and audit trail completeness.
