# Story 7.3: Failure Management & Recovery Tools

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** comprehensive failure management with pharmaceutical regulatory audit compliance,
**so that** pharmaceutical intelligence processing maintains high reliability with complete regulatory transparency and audit support.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Failure detection and alerting with pharmaceutical-specific error classification, severity levels, and audit trail integration
2. Failed request recovery interface with sub-process restart capabilities, manual intervention options, and audit documentation
3. Diagnostic tools providing detailed pharmaceutical processing logs, error analysis, and regulatory compliance reporting
4. Failure trend analysis identifying systemic pharmaceutical processing issues with audit trail of improvement opportunities
5. Recovery automation with intelligent retry logic, escalation procedures, and pharmaceutical compliance documentation
6. Failure reporting with pharmaceutical compliance documentation, root cause analysis, and complete audit trail support
7. System health monitoring with predictive alerts for potential pharmaceutical processing issues and regulatory compliance integration

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build failure detection and alerting system (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create failed request recovery interface (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement diagnostic tools with detailed logging (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add failure trend analysis capabilities (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create recovery automation with retry logic (AC: 5)
- [ ] Build failure reporting with root cause analysis (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement system health monitoring with predictive alerts (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Integrates with all pipeline stages for comprehensive failure management. Provides high-reliability operations with pharmaceutical compliance and audit requirements.

### Failure Management Framework
```python
class FailureManagement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.error_classifier = ErrorClassifier()
        self.recovery_engine = RecoveryEngine()
        self.diagnostic_tools = DiagnosticTools()
        self.trend_analyzer = TrendAnalyzer()
        self.audit_logger = AuditTrailLogger()

    def handle_failure(error, context):
        # Classify error
        # Attempt automated recovery
        # Log audit trail
        # Generate alerts if needed
        return recovery_status, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test failure detection accuracy, recovery automation effectiveness, diagnostic tool completeness, and trend analysis reliability.
