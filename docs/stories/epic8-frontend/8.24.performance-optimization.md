# Story 8.24: Performance Optimization

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** pharmaceutical researcher or system user,
**I want** optimal application performance with fast loading times,
**so that** I can work efficiently without delays or performance bottlenecks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Code splitting and lazy loading for improved initial load times
2. Image optimization with responsive images and lazy loading
3. Bundle size optimization with tree shaking and compression
4. Caching strategies for API responses and static assets
5. Virtual scrolling for large datasets and tables
6. Debounced search and input handling
7. Memoization and optimization of expensive computations
8. Progressive loading with skeleton screens and loading states
9. Performance monitoring and metrics collection
10. Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, FID, CLS)

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with performance optimization techniques
- **Bundling**: Webpack/Vite optimization with code splitting
- **Caching**: Browser caching and CDN integration
- **Monitoring**: Performance analytics and real user monitoring
- **Optimization**:
  - React.memo, useMemo, useCallback for component optimization
  - Virtual scrolling libraries for large lists
  - Image optimization tools and lazy loading
- **Components**:
  - Optimized data table components
  - Lazy-loaded route components
  - Performance monitoring widgets
  - Loading state components

## Dependencies
- All application components for optimization implementation
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for caching strategies
- Real-time monitoring interface (Story 8.17) for performance metrics
- Backend API optimization and CDN configuration

## Test Cases
1. Initial page load time meets performance targets
2. Code splitting reduces bundle sizes appropriately
3. Lazy loading improves perceived performance
4. Virtual scrolling handles large datasets smoothly
5. Caching reduces unnecessary API calls
6. Image optimization maintains quality while reducing size
7. Performance monitoring captures accurate metrics
8. Core Web Vitals scores meet Google recommendations
9. Memory usage remains stable during long sessions
10. Performance degrades gracefully under load

## Story Points
8

## Priority
P1 - High (User Experience)

## Dev Notes
- Implement performance budgets and monitoring alerts
- Add automated performance testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Consider implementing service worker caching strategies
- Add performance profiling and debugging tools
- Implement adaptive loading based on device capabilities
