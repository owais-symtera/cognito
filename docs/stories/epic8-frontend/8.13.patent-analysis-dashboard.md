# Story 8.13: Patent Analysis Dashboard

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** pharmaceutical researcher,
**I want** a comprehensive patent analysis dashboard,
**so that** I can understand the patent landscape, freedom to operate, and potential intellectual property risks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Patent search results with relevance scoring
2. Patent landscape visualization and mapping
3. Freedom to operate (FTO) analysis results
4. Patent family trees and relationships
5. Expiration timeline and patent life analysis
6. Competitive intelligence and assignee analysis
7. Citation network and prior art analysis
8. Risk assessment and blocking patents identification
9. Patent claims analysis and comparison
10. Interactive patent timeline and milestones

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with data visualization components
- **Charts**: D3.js for network diagrams and timeline visualization
- **Search**: Advanced filtering and search functionality
- **Styling**:
  - Dashboard layout with multiple data views
  - Interactive network visualizations
  - Timeline components
- **Components**:
  - Patent search interface
  - Network visualization for patent relationships
  - Timeline components for expiration analysis
  - Risk assessment indicators

## Dependencies
- Results summary view (Story 8.10) for integration
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for patent data
- Export & reporting features (Story 8.22) for report generation
- Backend patent analysis and search services

## Test Cases
1. Patent search returns relevant results with scores
2. Patent landscape visualization renders correctly
3. FTO analysis identifies potential risks accurately
4. Patent family trees display relationships properly
5. Timeline visualization shows expiration dates
6. Competitive analysis provides actionable insights
7. Citation networks load and interact smoothly
8. Risk assessment algorithms provide clear ratings
9. Claims comparison highlights key differences
10. Export functionality generates comprehensive reports
