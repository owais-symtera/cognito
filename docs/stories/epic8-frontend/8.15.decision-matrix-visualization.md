# Story 8.15: Decision Matrix Visualization

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** pharmaceutical researcher or decision maker,
**I want** an interactive decision matrix visualization,
**so that** I can compare different drug candidates and make data-driven decisions based on multiple criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-criteria decision matrix with customizable weights
2. Interactive scatter plots and bubble charts for comparison
3. Scoring algorithms with configurable parameters
4. What-if analysis and scenario planning tools
5. Risk-reward visualization and trade-off analysis
6. Ranking and scoring results with confidence intervals
7. Sensitivity analysis for decision parameters
8. Decision rationale capture and documentation
9. Comparative analysis with benchmark compounds
10. Export decision matrix and recommendations

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with advanced data visualization
- **Charts**: D3.js for custom interactive visualizations
- **Math**: Decision analysis algorithms and statistical functions
- **Styling**:
  - Interactive matrix interfaces
  - Drag-and-drop weight configuration
  - Responsive visualization layouts
- **Components**:
  - Decision matrix table/grid
  - Interactive visualization components
  - Weight configuration sliders
  - Scenario analysis interface

## Dependencies
- Results summary view (Story 8.10) for input data
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for decision calculations
- Export & reporting features (Story 8.22) for decision reports
- Backend decision analysis and scoring services

## Test Cases
1. Decision matrix loads with appropriate criteria
2. Weight adjustments update scores dynamically
3. Visualizations reflect data changes accurately
4. Scenario analysis produces valid results
5. Sensitivity analysis identifies critical parameters
6. Decision documentation saves properly
7. Comparative analysis functions correctly
8. Export generates comprehensive decision reports
9. Interactive elements respond to user manipulation
10. Performance remains smooth with complex analyses
