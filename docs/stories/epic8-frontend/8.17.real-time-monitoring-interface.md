# Story 8.17: Real-time Monitoring Interface

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** system administrator or DevOps engineer,
**I want** a real-time system monitoring interface,
**so that** I can monitor system health, performance metrics, and operational status in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time system performance metrics dashboard
2. Service health status indicators and uptime monitoring
3. Resource utilization graphs (CPU, memory, disk, network)
4. Processing queue monitoring and throughput metrics
5. Error rate tracking and alert thresholds
6. User activity and concurrent session monitoring
7. Database performance and connection pool status
8. API response time and success rate metrics
9. Custom metric configuration and alerting rules
10. Historical performance data and trend analysis

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with real-time data visualization
- **Real-time**: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for live updates
- **Charts**: Chart.js or D3.js for metric visualization
- **Styling**:
  - Monitoring dashboard layout
  - Status indicator color schemes
  - Responsive metric displays
- **Components**:
  - Real-time metric widgets
  - Status indicator components
  - Alert notification system
  - Historical trend charts

## Dependencies
- WebSocket real-time updates (Story 8.21) for live data
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for monitoring endpoints
- System configuration dashboard (Story 8.16) for alert settings
- Backend monitoring and metrics collection services

## Test Cases
1. Real-time metrics update without page refresh
2. Status indicators reflect actual system health
3. Resource utilization displays accurate data
4. Alert thresholds trigger notifications appropriately
5. Historical data loads and displays correctly
6. Custom metrics can be configured and monitored
7. Performance remains smooth with continuous updates
8. Error states handle monitoring service failures
9. User activity tracking functions accurately
10. Dashboard scales with different metric volumes

## Story Points
