# Story 8.11: Source Analysis & Conflicts UI

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** pharmaceutical researcher,
**I want** an interface to view source analysis and resolve data conflicts,
**so that** I can understand data reliability and make informed decisions about conflicting information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Source credibility scores and reliability indicators
2. Conflict detection and highlighting across data sources
3. Side-by-side comparison of conflicting information
4. Source priority and weighting configuration
5. Manual conflict resolution with justification tracking
6. Data lineage and provenance visualization
7. Source filtering and exclusion capabilities
8. Confidence intervals and uncertainty indicators
9. Automated conflict resolution suggestions
10. Source analysis audit trail

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with complex state management
- **Visualization**: D3.js for network diagrams and data lineage
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side diff components
- **Styling**:
  - Tabbed interface for source comparison
  - Color-coded conflict indicators
  - Interactive network visualizations
- **Components**:
  - Source comparison tables
  - Conflict resolution interface
  - Data lineage visualization
  - Source filtering controls

## Dependencies
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for source data
- Results summary view (Story 8.10) for integration
- Audit trail viewer (Story 8.20) for tracking decisions
- Backend source analysis and conflict detection

## Test Cases
1. Source credibility scores display accurately
2. Conflicts are detected and highlighted properly
3. Side-by-side comparisons show differences clearly
4. Manual resolutions save with proper justification
5. Source filtering updates results appropriately
6. Data lineage visualization renders correctly
7. Automated suggestions provide reasonable options
8. Audit trail captures all resolution decisions
9. Confidence indicators reflect data quality
10. Source exclusion affects downstream analysis

## Story Points
