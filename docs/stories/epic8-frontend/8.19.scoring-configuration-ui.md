# Story 8.19: Scoring Configuration UI

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** system administrator or data scientist,
**I want** a scoring configuration interface,
**so that** I can customize and tune the scoring algorithms and weights used in drug analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Algorithm parameter configuration with validation
2. Scoring weight adjustment for different criteria
3. Custom scoring model creation and management
4. A/B testing framework for scoring algorithms
5. Scoring model versioning and rollback capabilities
6. Performance impact analysis for scoring changes
7. Scoring model validation and testing tools
8. Import/export functionality for scoring configurations
9. Real-time scoring preview with sample data
10. Scoring audit trail and change management

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with advanced form management
- **Validation**: Complex validation schemas for algorithm parameters
- **Testing**: A/B testing framework integration
- **Styling**:
  - Scientific/technical interface design
  - Parameter configuration forms
  - Real-time preview components
- **Components**:
  - Algorithm parameter forms
  - Weight adjustment sliders
  - Model testing interface
  - Version control components

## Dependencies
- System configuration dashboard (Story 8.16) for administrative access
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for scoring configuration endpoints
- Audit trail viewer (Story 8.20) for change tracking
- Backend scoring engine and configuration services

## Test Cases
1. Algorithm parameters save and apply correctly
2. Weight adjustments produce expected scoring changes
3. Custom scoring models function as designed
4. A/B testing framework operates reliably
5. Version control maintains configuration history
6. Performance analysis identifies optimization opportunities
7. Validation tools prevent invalid configurations
8. Import/export preserves configuration integrity
9. Real-time preview accurately reflects changes
10. Audit trail captures all configuration modifications

## Story Points
