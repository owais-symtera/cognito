# Story 8.8: Real-time Processing Status

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** pharmaceutical researcher,
**I want** real-time visibility into drug analysis processing status,
**so that** I can monitor progress and understand when results will be available.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time progress indicators for each processing stage
2. Estimated time remaining calculations
3. Visual progress bars with percentage completion
4. Processing queue position and wait time
5. Error and warning notifications during processing
6. Detailed processing logs and step-by-step breakdown
7. Ability to cancel or pause processing requests
8. Processing history and timeline view
9. Resource utilization indicators
10. Push notifications for status changes

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with WebSocket integration
- **Real-time**: Socket.io or native WebSocket for live updates
- **Visualization**: Progress bars, status badges, timeline components
- **Styling**:
  - Animated progress indicators
  - Color-coded status states
  - Responsive status dashboard
- **Components**:
  - Progress tracking widgets
  - Processing timeline component
  - Status notification system
  - Resource utilization charts

## Dependencies
- WebSocket real-time updates (Story 8.21) for live data
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for status endpoints
- Authentication system (Story 8.1) for user context
- Backend processing pipeline with status reporting

## Test Cases
1. Progress updates reflect real processing status
2. Time estimates adjust based on actual progress
3. Error states display with actionable information
4. Cancellation requests process immediately
5. WebSocket reconnection handles connection drops
6. Processing logs show detailed step information
7. Queue position updates in real-time
8. Notifications trigger at appropriate milestones
9. Resource indicators show accurate utilization
10. Historical timeline displays correctly
