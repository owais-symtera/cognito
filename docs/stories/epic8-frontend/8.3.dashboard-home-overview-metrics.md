Ready

## Story
**As a** pharmaceutical researcher or system administrator,
**I want** a comprehensive dashboard home page with key metrics and insights,
**so that** I can quickly understand system status, recent activity, and key performance indicators at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Recent drug requests summary with status breakdown
3. Processing queue status and estimated completion times
4. System health indicators and resource utilization
5. Quick action buttons for common tasks (new request, view reports)
6. Recent activity feed with timestamps and user actions
7. Interactive charts showing trends over time periods
8. Alerts and notifications section for important updates
9. Customizable widget layout for different user roles
10. Data refresh indicators and last updated timestamps

## Technical Requirements
