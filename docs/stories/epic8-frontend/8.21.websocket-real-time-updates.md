# Story 8.21: WebSocket Real-time Updates

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** pharmaceutical researcher or system user,
**I want** real-time updates throughout the application via WebSocket connections,
**so that** I can see live changes, status updates, and notifications without manual page refreshes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. WebSocket connection management with automatic reconnection
2. Real-time processing status updates across all request views
3. Live notification delivery for system alerts and messages
4. Multi-user collaboration with live activity indicators
5. Real-time dashboard metric updates without page refresh
6. Connection status indicators and offline mode handling
7. Message queuing and replay for missed updates
8. Selective subscription to relevant update channels
9. Bandwidth optimization with update batching and throttling
10. Graceful degradation when WebSocket is unavailable

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with WebSocket client integration
- **WebSocket**: Socket.io or native WebSocket with reconnection logic
- **State**: Event-driven state updates across components
- **Styling**:
  - Connection status indicators
  - Real-time update animations
  - Offline mode styling
- **Components**:
  - WebSocket provider and hook system
  - Connection status component
  - Real-time notification system
  - Live update indicators

## Dependencies
- Authentication system (Story 8.1) for connection authentication
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for fallback mechanisms
- All components requiring real-time updates
- Backend WebSocket server and event broadcasting

## Test Cases
1. WebSocket connection establishes successfully
2. Real-time updates propagate to appropriate components
3. Automatic reconnection works after connection loss
4. Message queuing handles missed updates correctly
5. Subscription filtering delivers relevant updates only
6. Connection status displays accurately
7. Offline mode provides appropriate fallback behavior
8. Update batching optimizes performance
9. Authentication integrates with WebSocket connections
10. Graceful degradation maintains core functionality

## Story Points
8

## Priority
P1 - High (User Experience)

## Dev Notes
- Implement connection pooling and load balancing
- Add real-time update conflict resolution
- Consider implementing WebRTC for peer-to-peer updates
- Add real-time update analytics and monitoring
- Implement adaptive update frequency based on user activity
