# Story 8.18: Failure Management Console

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** system administrator or support engineer,
**I want** a comprehensive failure management console,
**so that** I can identify, diagnose, and resolve system failures efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Centralized failure detection and alerting system
2. Failure categorization and severity classification
3. Root cause analysis tools and diagnostic information
4. Automated failure recovery and retry mechanisms
5. Failure pattern analysis and trend identification
6. Incident management workflow and tracking
7. Failure impact assessment and user notification
8. Manual intervention tools and override capabilities
9. Failure reporting and post-mortem documentation
10. Integration with external monitoring and alerting systems

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with incident management components
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live failure notifications
- **Workflow**: State machine for incident lifecycle management
- **Styling**:
  - Emergency/alert color schemes
  - Status-based UI components
  - Responsive incident management interface
- **Components**:
  - Failure detection dashboard
  - Incident workflow interface
  - Diagnostic tools and logs viewer
  - Recovery action controls

## Dependencies
- Real-time monitoring interface (Story 8.17) for failure detection
- API integration layer (Story 8.5) for failure management operations
- Audit trail viewer (Story 8.20) for incident tracking
- Backend failure detection and recovery services

## Test Cases
1. Failures are detected and categorized correctly
2. Severity classification triggers appropriate responses
3. Root cause analysis provides actionable insights
4. Automated recovery mechanisms function properly
5. Manual intervention tools work as expected
6. Incident workflow tracks status changes accurately
7. Failure notifications reach appropriate personnel
8. Impact assessment calculates correctly
9. Post-mortem documentation captures essential information
10. External system integration functions reliably
