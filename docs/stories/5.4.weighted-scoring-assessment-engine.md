# Story 5.4: Weighted Scoring Assessment Engine

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Investment Analyst (Pharmaceutical Focus),
**I want** sophisticated weighted scoring with comprehensive pharmaceutical audit compliance,
**so that** pharmaceutical investment decisions reflect balanced assessment with complete regulatory transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Weighted scoring algorithm combining pharmaceutical technical, commercial, regulatory, competitive factors with audit trail integration
2. Configurable weighting schemes for pharmaceutical analysis contexts (R&D, M&A, licensing) with regulatory compliance documentation
3. Risk-adjusted scoring incorporating pharmaceutical development uncertainties with audit trail of risk assessment methodologies
4. Sensitivity analysis showing pharmaceutical scoring changes with different assumptions and audit documentation
5. Portfolio-level weighted scoring for pharmaceutical pipeline prioritization with complete audit trail integration
6. Weighted scoring validation against pharmaceutical industry benchmarks with regulatory compliance documentation
7. Confidence scoring indicating pharmaceutical weighted assessment methodology reliability with audit trail support

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build weighted scoring algorithm for pharmaceutical factors (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create configurable weighting schemes for analysis contexts (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement risk-adjusted scoring with uncertainty handling (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add sensitivity analysis for assumption variations (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create portfolio-level weighted scoring (AC: 5)
- [ ] Implement weighted scoring validation against benchmarks (AC: 6)
- [ ] Add confidence scoring for methodology reliability (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Integrates with Story 5.3 scoring matrices and Story 5.2 decision rules. Provides comprehensive weighted assessment engine for pharmaceutical investment and strategic decisions.

### Weighted Scoring Engine
```python
class WeightedScoringEngine:
    CONTEXT_WEIGHTS = {
        'rd_focus': {'technical': 0.4, 'regulatory': 0.3, 'commercial': 0.2, 'competitive': 0.1},
        'ma_focus': {'commercial': 0.4, 'competitive': 0.3, 'technical': 0.2, 'regulatory': 0.1},
        'licensing_focus': {'regulatory': 0.4, 'technical': 0.3, 'commercial': 0.2, 'competitive': 0.1}
    }
```

## Testing
Test weighted scoring accuracy, sensitivity analysis functionality, portfolio scoring, and benchmark validation completeness.
