# Story 3.1: Source Authentication & Hierarchy Verification

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Data Quality Engineer,
**I want** automated source authentication using established hierarchy with comprehensive audit documentation,
**so that** pharmaceutical intelligence data is automatically prioritized based on source reliability while maintaining regulatory compliance transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Source classification engine identifying source types from URLs, domains, and content patterns with audit logging
2. Source authority scoring implementing hierarchical weighting (Paid APIs: 10x, .gov: 8x, Peer-reviewed: 6x, Industry: 4x, Company: 2x, News: 1x)
3. Domain whitelist and blacklist management for pharmaceutical industry trusted and blocked sources
4. Publication date extraction and recency scoring with pharmaceutical industry relevance weighting
5. Author and publication credibility assessment for medical and regulatory content with audit trail
6. Source verification status tracking integrated with processId system: verified, unverified, flagged, blocked with reasoning
7. Verification confidence scoring providing data quality indicators for downstream pharmaceutical processing

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build source classification engine (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement hierarchical authority scoring (AC: 2)
- [x] Create domain whitelist/blacklist management (AC: 3)
- [x] Add publication date and recency scoring (AC: 4)
- [x] Build author/publication credibility assessment (AC: 5)
- [x] Implement verification status tracking (AC: 6)
- [x] Create verification confidence scoring (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on Epic 2 completion for source data availability and Epic 1 for audit trail integration.

### Source Authority Weighting
```python
class SourceWeights(IntEnum):
    PAID_APIS = 10      # ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.
    GOVERNMENT = 8      # .gov, .edu domains
    PEER_REVIEWED = 6   # Academic journals
    INDUSTRY = 4        # Professional associations
    COMPANY = 2         # Pharmaceutical companies
    NEWS = 1            # News and media
```

## Testing
Test source classification accuracy, authority scoring, and verification status tracking.
