# Story 7.2: Real-time Process Monitoring Dashboard

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Pharmaceutical Operations Manager,
**I want** comprehensive real-time monitoring with pharmaceutical regulatory audit compliance,
**so that** I can ensure reliable pharmaceutical intelligence delivery while maintaining complete regulatory transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time dashboard showing all active pharmaceutical analysis requests with current status, progress, and audit trail integration
2. Process timeline visualization showing pharmaceutical analysis flow through all pipeline stages with regulatory compliance tracking
3. Performance metrics display with pharmaceutical processing times, success rates, quality indicators, and compliance reporting
4. Queue monitoring showing pharmaceutical analysis backlog, estimated completion times, and audit trail documentation
5. Resource utilization monitoring with pharmaceutical system capacity, scaling indicators, and regulatory compliance metrics
6. Alert system for pharmaceutical processing failures, performance degradation, quality issues with audit trail integration
7. Historical performance analysis supporting pharmaceutical operational optimization, capacity planning, and regulatory compliance reporting

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build real-time dashboard for active analysis requests (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create process timeline visualization (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement performance metrics display (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add queue monitoring with completion estimates (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create resource utilization monitoring (AC: 5)
- [ ] Implement alert system for failures and performance issues (AC: 6)
- [ ] Build historical performance analysis tools (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Integrates with all pipeline stages from Epics 1-6 for comprehensive monitoring. Provides real-time operational visibility with pharmaceutical compliance requirements.

### Monitoring Dashboard Framework
```python
class ProcessMonitoring:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pipeline_tracker = PipelineTracker()
        self.metrics_collector = MetricsCollector()
        self.alert_manager = AlertManager()
        self.audit_logger = AuditTrailLogger()

    def get_real_time_status():
        # Collect pipeline status
        # Calculate performance metrics
        # Monitor resource utilization
        # Generate compliance reporting
        return dashboard_data, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test real-time dashboard accuracy, performance metrics calculation, alert system responsiveness, and historical analysis functionality.
