# Story 5.5: Go/No-Go Verdict Generation

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Pharmaceutical Executive,
**I want** clear Go/No-Go recommendations with comprehensive pharmaceutical regulatory audit compliance,
**so that** strategic pharmaceutical decisions have objective foundation with complete regulatory transparency and audit support.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Binary decision algorithm processing all Phase 1 pharmaceutical data into clear Go/No-Go recommendations with audit trail integration
2. Decision rationale generation explaining pharmaceutical Go/No-Go verdict factors with regulatory compliance documentation
3. Confidence scoring indicating pharmaceutical decision recommendation reliability with audit trail of confidence calculation methodology
4. Risk assessment integration ensuring pharmaceutical Go/No-Go decisions account for identified risks with audit documentation
5. Decision threshold configuration allowing pharmaceutical organizations to adjust risk tolerance with regulatory compliance audit trails
6. Complete decision audit trail maintaining reasoning chain for pharmaceutical regulatory and governance compliance
7. Decision override documentation supporting pharmaceutical expert judgment integration with complete audit trail support

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build binary decision algorithm for Go/No-Go recommendations (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create decision rationale generation system (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring for decision reliability (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add risk assessment integration (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create decision threshold configuration (AC: 5)
- [ ] Build complete decision audit trail system (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement decision override documentation (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Integrates with all previous Epic 5 stories to generate final binary decisions. Combines LLM processing, rule-based logic, scoring matrices, and weighted assessments into clear Go/No-Go verdicts.

### Go/No-Go Decision Engine
```python
class GoNoGoDecision:
    def generate_verdict(weighted_scores, risk_assessment, thresholds):
        # Apply decision thresholds
        # Generate rationale
        # Calculate confidence score
        # Create audit trail
        return verdict, rationale, confidence, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test binary decision accuracy, rationale generation quality, confidence scoring reliability, and audit trail completeness.
