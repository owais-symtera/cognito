# Story 4.5: JSON Output Standardization & Export

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Business Development Manager,
**I want** standardized JSON output for all pharmaceutical categories with regulatory compliance formatting,
**so that** pharmaceutical intelligence integrates seamlessly with existing business systems while maintaining audit compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. JSON schema definition for all 17 pharmaceutical categories with industry-standard field names and regulatory compliance formatting
2. JSON validation ensuring pharmaceutical category outputs conform to industry standards with audit trail integration
3. Export functionality supporting formats: JSON, CSV, Excel, PDF for pharmaceutical business needs with audit documentation
4. Data visualization integration preparing JSON outputs for pharmaceutical dashboards with regulatory compliance features
5. JSON versioning and backward compatibility maintaining integration stability with audit trail of schema changes
6. JSON compression and optimization reducing transfer overhead for large pharmaceutical analysis results
7. JSON security and privacy controls ensuring pharmaceutical data protection with regulatory compliance during export

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Define JSON schema for all 17 pharmaceutical categories (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement JSON validation with industry standards (AC: 2)
- [x] Create export functionality for multiple formats (AC: 3)
- [x] Add data visualization integration preparation (AC: 4)
- [x] Implement JSON versioning and backward compatibility (AC: 5)
- [x] Add JSON compression and optimization (AC: 6)
- [x] Create JSON security and privacy controls (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Builds on Story 4.4 Phase 1 category processing outputs. Supports all 17 pharmaceutical categories (10 Phase 1 + 7 Phase 2) with industry-standard formatting and regulatory compliance.

### JSON Schema Structure
```python
class PharmaceuticalJSON:
    SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.0"
    CATEGORIES = {
        'phase_1': 10,  # From Story 4.4
        'phase_2': 7,   # For Epic 5
        'total': 17
    }
```

## Testing
Test JSON schema validation, export format accuracy, compression effectiveness, and security controls compliance.
