# Story 3.5: Verification Reporting & Quality Metrics

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Pharmaceutical Research Director,
**I want** comprehensive verification reporting with pharmaceutical compliance metrics,
**so that** I can assess data reliability for strategic pharmaceutical decisions while maintaining regulatory audit compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Verification summary reports with source coverage, conflict resolution outcomes, and pharmaceutical quality scores
2. Category-specific quality metrics indicating pharmaceutical intelligence completeness per analysis area
3. Source contribution analysis showing most valuable pharmaceutical data sources with audit trail integration
4. Data quality trends and improvement recommendations based on pharmaceutical verification processing history
5. Real-time verification status updates integrated with processId tracking for pharmaceutical operational monitoring
6. Quality threshold alerts when verification results fall below pharmaceutical decision-making standards
7. Comprehensive pharmaceutical compliance reporting supporting regulatory audit requirements and operational optimization

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build verification summary reports with quality scores (AC: 1)
- [x] Create category-specific quality metrics (AC: 2)
- [x] Implement source contribution analysis (AC: 3)
- [x] Add data quality trends and improvement recommendations (AC: 4)
- [x] Create real-time verification status updates (AC: 5)
- [x] Implement quality threshold alerts system (AC: 6)
- [x] Build comprehensive compliance reporting (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on all previous Epic 3 stories for complete verification data. Integrates with Epic 1 processId system for real-time tracking and pharmaceutical compliance requirements.

### Quality Metrics Framework
```python
class QualityMetrics:
    def generate_verification_report():
        # Source coverage analysis
        # Conflict resolution statistics
        # Category completeness scores
        # Compliance indicators
        return verification_report
```

## Testing
Test report generation accuracy, quality metrics calculation, alert threshold functionality, and compliance reporting completeness.
