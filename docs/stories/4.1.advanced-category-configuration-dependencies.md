# Story 4.1: Advanced Category Configuration & Dependencies

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** advanced category management with dependency tracking and pharmaceutical workflow optimization,
**so that** pharmaceutical organizations can configure complex category relationships while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Enhanced category configuration expanding Epic 1.3 with dependency management and workflow optimization
2. Category dependency graph supporting complex pharmaceutical analysis workflows with audit trail integration
3. Advanced category profiles for pharmaceutical analysis scenarios: regulatory focus, market focus, technical focus, compliance focus
4. Category activation validation ensuring all prerequisite categories and dependencies are properly configured
5. Category workflow optimization suggesting optimal category combinations for specific pharmaceutical analysis types
6. Advanced configuration UI with pharmaceutical category explanations, dependencies, and cost optimization guidance
7. Category usage analytics and optimization recommendations based on pharmaceutical processing history and audit trails

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Enhance category configuration with dependency management (AC: 1)
- [x] Build category dependency graph system (AC: 2)
- [x] Create advanced category profiles for analysis scenarios (AC: 3)
- [x] Implement category activation validation (AC: 4)
- [x] Add category workflow optimization suggestions (AC: 5)
- [x] Build advanced configuration UI with guidance (AC: 6)
- [x] Create category usage analytics and recommendations (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Extends Epic 1.3 basic category configuration with advanced dependency tracking. Integrates with pharmaceutical analysis workflows and cost optimization requirements.

### Category Dependency Graph
```python
class CategoryDependency:
    ANALYSIS_PROFILES = {
        'regulatory_focus': ['regulatory_status', 'patent_status', 'clinical_trials'],
        'market_focus': ['market_overview', 'competitive_landscape', 'commercial_opportunities'],
        'technical_focus': ['physicochemical_profile', 'pharmacokinetics', 'formulations']
    }
```

## Testing
Test dependency validation, workflow optimization accuracy, and configuration UI functionality with pharmaceutical category combinations.
