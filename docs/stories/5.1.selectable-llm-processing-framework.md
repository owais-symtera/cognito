# Story 5.1: Selectable LLM Processing Framework

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** AI Systems Engineer,
**I want** configurable LLM selection with pharmaceutical compliance audit integration,
**so that** pharmaceutical organizations can optimize AI processing while maintaining regulatory transparency and audit compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LLM provider abstraction layer supporting multiple AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock) with audit trail integration
2. LLM selection configuration per Phase 2 category with fallback options and pharmaceutical compliance documentation
3. LLM performance monitoring tracking processing time, cost, pharmaceutical decision quality with audit trails
4. LLM prompt optimization ensuring consistent pharmaceutical domain expertise with regulatory compliance validation
5. LLM response validation ensuring Phase 2 outputs meet pharmaceutical decision-making standards with audit documentation
6. Cost optimization algorithms selecting most cost-effective LLM with pharmaceutical analysis audit trails
7. Complete LLM audit trail tracking which AI models generated pharmaceutical decision intelligence with regulatory compliance

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build LLM provider abstraction layer (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create LLM selection configuration per Phase 2 category (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement LLM performance monitoring (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add LLM prompt optimization for pharmaceutical domain (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create LLM response validation system (AC: 5)
- [ ] Implement cost optimization algorithms (AC: 6)
- [ ] Build complete LLM audit trail system (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on Epic 4 Phase 1 processing completion. Introduces Phase 2 LLM-based intelligence processing with multiple AI provider support and pharmaceutical compliance audit requirements.

### LLM Provider Framework
```python
class LLMProvider:
    SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS = [
        'openai', 'anthropic', 'google', 'azure', 'aws_bedrock'
    ]

    def select_optimal_llm(category, cost_constraints, performance_requirements):
        # Provider selection logic
        # Cost optimization
        # Performance monitoring
        return selected_provider, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test LLM provider integration, selection logic, performance monitoring, and audit trail completeness across multiple AI services.
