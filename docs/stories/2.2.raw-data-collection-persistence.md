    __tablename__ = "api_responses"

    id: str = Field(primary_key=True, default_factory=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    process_id: str = Field(foreign_key="process_tracking.id")
    request_id: str = Field(foreign_key="drug_requests.id")

    # API details
    provider: str = Field(..., max_length=50)  # chatgpt, perplexity, etc.
    query: str = Field(...)
    temperature: float = Field(...)

    # Response data (encrypted JSONB)
    raw_response: Dict = Field(...)  # Complete API response
    standardized_response: Dict = Field(...)  # Processed format

    # Metadata
    response_time_ms: int = Field(...)
    cost: float = Field(default=0.0)
    token_count: Optional[int] = None
    result_count: int = Field(default=0)

    # Pharmaceutical context
    pharmaceutical_compound: str = Field(...)
    category: str = Field(...)

    # Quality metrics
    relevance_score: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    quality_score: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)

    # Audit trail
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)

| Compliance | No automated retention enforcement | MEDIUM | Add scheduled job for retention cleanup |

#### Test Coverage Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive unit tests for DataPersistenceManager
- Good coverage of repository operations
- Checksum validation testing
- Retention policy verification

**Gaps:**
- No integration tests with real database
- Missing concurrent write stress testing
- No encryption performance testing
- Limited error recovery testing

#### Code Quality Assessment

**Positive Findings:**
1. **Well-structured architecture** - Clear separation of concerns
2. **Comprehensive documentation** - Detailed docstrings and inline comments
3. **Strong typing** - Proper use of type hints throughout
4. **Audit trail integration** - Complete logging of data operations
5. **Flexible storage** - JSONB allows schema evolution

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Error handling** - Generic exception catching in some places
2. **Configuration** - Hardcoded 7-year retention should be configurable
3. **Monitoring** - Add metrics for storage usage and performance
4. **Batch operations** - Limited support for bulk inserts

#### Security Review

✅ **Strengths:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption implementation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- SHA-256 integrity checksums
- Audit logging for all operations

⚠️ **Concerns:**
- Encryption keys stored in environment variables (consider KMS)
- No field-level encryption granularity
- Missing data anonymization for analytics

#### Performance Considerations

**Optimizations Needed:**
1. Add database connection pooling
2. Implement batch insert for multiple responses
3. Consider partitioning for large tables
4. Add caching layer for frequent queries

#### Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Database migrations created
- [x] Core functionality implemented
- [x] Unit tests comprehensive
- [ ] Integration tests needed
- [ ] Load testing required
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Runbook documentation
- [x] Security controls implemented
- [ ] Performance tuning completed

#### Specific Recommendations

1. **Enable encryption in production** - Ensure encryption_enabled=True
2. **Add retention job** - Create scheduled task for retention enforcement
3. **Implement monitoring** - Add CloudWatch/Datadog metrics
4. **Enhance error recovery** - Add retry logic and circuit breakers
5. **Document runbooks** - Create operational procedures

#### Quality Score: 8.5/10

**Breakdown:**
- Functionality: 9/10 (All core features working)
- Security: 8/10 (Good foundation, needs hardening)
- Performance: 7/10 (Optimizations needed for scale)
- Testing: 8/10 (Good unit tests, needs integration)
- Documentation: 9/10 (Excellent inline docs)
- Maintainability: 9/10 (Clean architecture)

### QA Conclusion

Story 2.2 successfully implements a robust data persistence layer with strong pharmaceutical compliance features. The 7-year retention policy, comprehensive audit trail, and data integrity validation meet regulatory requirements. While the core functionality is solid, production deployment requires enabling encryption, implementing automated retention enforcement, and adding performance optimizations for scale.

**Final Verdict**: Ready for staging deployment with mandatory security enhancements before production.
