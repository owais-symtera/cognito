# Story 3.2: Data Conflict Detection & Resolution

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Pharmaceutical Analyst,
**I want** intelligent conflict detection and resolution with complete decision audit trails,
**so that** final pharmaceutical intelligence reports present accurate, authoritative information with regulatory compliance documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Conflict detection algorithms identifying contradictory data points across sources within pharmaceutical categories
2. Weighted conflict resolution using source hierarchy from Story 3.1 with configurable override capabilities
3. Threshold-based consensus building requiring multiple source confirmation with audit trail documentation
4. Conflict documentation and flagging for manual review integrated with processId tracking
5. Statistical analysis of confidence intervals for numerical pharmaceutical data with regulatory compliance scoring
6. Expert review workflow integration for complex pharmaceutical conflicts with audit trail maintenance
7. Complete conflict resolution audit trail: sources compared, resolution algorithm used, confidence scores, final decisions

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build conflict detection algorithms for pharmaceutical data (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement weighted resolution using source hierarchy (AC: 2)
- [x] Create threshold-based consensus building (AC: 3)
- [x] Add conflict documentation and manual review flagging (AC: 4)
- [x] Build statistical analysis for numerical data confidence (AC: 5)
- [x] Implement expert review workflow integration (AC: 6)
- [x] Create complete conflict resolution audit trail (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on Story 3.1 for source hierarchy and Epic 2 for multi-source data availability. Integrates with processId system from Epic 1 for audit trail tracking.

### Conflict Resolution Priority
```python
class ConflictResolution:
    def resolve_conflict(sources, data_points):
        # Use source weights from Story 3.1
        # Apply threshold-based consensus
        # Generate audit trail
        return resolved_data, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test conflict detection across pharmaceutical categories, resolution accuracy with source hierarchy, and audit trail completeness.
