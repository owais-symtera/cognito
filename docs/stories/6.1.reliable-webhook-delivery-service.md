# Story 6.1: Reliable Webhook Delivery Service

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Business Development Manager,
**I want** guaranteed webhook delivery with comprehensive pharmaceutical audit compliance,
**so that** pharmaceutical intelligence results reliably reach business systems with complete regulatory transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Webhook delivery service with exponential backoff retry logic, configurable retry limits, and audit trail integration
2. Delivery confirmation tracking with webhook response validation, status monitoring, and pharmaceutical compliance documentation
3. Dead letter queue handling for failed deliveries with manual intervention capabilities and audit trail support
4. Webhook payload encryption and authentication ensuring pharmaceutical data security with regulatory compliance audit trails
5. Delivery performance monitoring with SLA tracking, alerting for delivery failures, and pharmaceutical compliance reporting
6. Webhook endpoint validation and health checking with audit trail of endpoint status and pharmaceutical system connectivity
7. Complete delivery audit trail linking webhook results to original requestID and processId with regulatory compliance documentation

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build webhook delivery service with exponential backoff (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create delivery confirmation tracking system (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement dead letter queue for failed deliveries (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add webhook payload encryption and authentication (AC: 4)
- [ ] Build delivery performance monitoring with SLA tracking (AC: 5)
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint validation and health checking (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement complete delivery audit trail system (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on Epic 5 completion for final pharmaceutical intelligence results. Implements reliable delivery system with comprehensive audit compliance for enterprise integration.

### Webhook Delivery Framework
```python
class WebhookDelivery:
    def __init__(self):
        self.retry_strategy = ExponentialBackoff()
        self.dead_letter_queue = DeadLetterQueue()
        self.audit_trail = AuditTrailLogger()

    def deliver_webhook(payload, endpoint, request_id):
        # Encrypt payload
        # Attempt delivery with retries
        # Track confirmation
        # Log audit trail
        return delivery_status, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test delivery reliability, retry logic effectiveness, security measures, and audit trail completeness under various failure scenarios.
