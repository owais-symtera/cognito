# Story 3.4: Validated Data Merging & Consolidation

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Data Scientist,
**I want** intelligent merging of validated data with comprehensive pharmaceutical audit compliance,
**so that** final outputs provide authoritative pharmaceutical intelligence with complete regulatory documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Merging algorithms combining complementary data from multiple sources with audit trail of merge decisions
2. Data enrichment logic enhancing incomplete records with audit documentation of enhancement sources
3. Temporal data handling for historical pharmaceutical information with time-series audit compliance
4. Geographic data consolidation for global pharmaceutical markets with regulatory jurisdiction tracking
5. Confidence scoring for merged data indicating reliability with pharmaceutical regulatory compliance metrics
6. Complete merging audit trail documenting source contributions for every data element
7. Quality assurance validation ensuring merged pharmaceutical data maintains industry accuracy standards

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build merging algorithms for complementary data combination (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement data enrichment logic with audit documentation (AC: 2)
- [x] Create temporal data handling for historical information (AC: 3)
- [x] Add geographic data consolidation with jurisdiction tracking (AC: 4)
- [x] Implement confidence scoring for merged data (AC: 5)
- [x] Create complete merging audit trail system (AC: 6)
- [x] Build quality assurance validation for merged data (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on Story 3.3 for validated data inputs and Story 3.2 for conflict resolution. Integrates with geographic and temporal data handling for global pharmaceutical markets.

### Data Merging Strategy
```python
class DataMerger:
    def merge_pharmaceutical_data(validated_sources):
        # Apply merging algorithms
        # Enrich incomplete records
        # Handle temporal and geographic data
        # Generate confidence scores
        # Create audit trail
        return merged_data, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test merging algorithm accuracy, data enrichment effectiveness, temporal/geographic handling, and audit trail completeness.
