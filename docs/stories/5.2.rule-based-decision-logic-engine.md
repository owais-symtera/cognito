# Story 5.2: Rule-Based Decision Logic Engine

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Pharmaceutical Strategy Consultant,
**I want** configurable pharmaceutical decision logic with comprehensive audit compliance,
**so that** strategic recommendations reflect established pharmaceutical decision-making frameworks while maintaining regulatory transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Rule engine supporting pharmaceutical decision trees with configurable weighting, thresholds, and audit trail integration
2. Decision rule database allowing pharmaceutical experts to modify business logic with regulatory compliance documentation
3. Multi-criteria decision analysis incorporating market, regulatory, technical, commercial factors with audit trails
4. Rule validation ensuring pharmaceutical decision logic consistency with audit documentation of validation processes
5. Decision rule versioning and A/B testing with pharmaceutical compliance audit trails and effectiveness tracking
6. Rule performance analytics tracking pharmaceutical decision accuracy against real-world outcomes with audit integration
7. Expert override capabilities with complete audit trail of pharmaceutical domain expert judgment integration

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build rule engine with pharmaceutical decision trees (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create decision rule database for expert modifications (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement multi-criteria decision analysis (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add rule validation and consistency checking (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create decision rule versioning and A/B testing (AC: 5)
- [ ] Build rule performance analytics (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement expert override capabilities with audit trails (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Integrates with Story 5.1 LLM processing for decision intelligence generation. Supports pharmaceutical decision-making frameworks with configurable business logic and regulatory compliance.

### Decision Rule Framework
```python
class DecisionRules:
    CRITERIA_WEIGHTS = {
        'market_potential': 0.25,
        'regulatory_feasibility': 0.30,
        'technical_viability': 0.20,
        'commercial_viability': 0.25
    }

    def evaluate_decision(pharmaceutical_data, rules_version):
        # Apply decision rules
        # Calculate weighted scores
        # Generate audit trail
        return decision_recommendation, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test rule engine accuracy, multi-criteria analysis, versioning functionality, and expert override audit trail completeness.
