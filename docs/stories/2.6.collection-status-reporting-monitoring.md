# Story 2.6: Collection Status Reporting & Monitoring

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Pharmaceutical Research Director,
**I want** real-time visibility into data collection progress with comprehensive audit reporting,
**so that** I can assess pharmaceutical intelligence gathering comprehensiveness and maintain regulatory compliance transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Collection progress API endpoint showing per-category data gathering status with audit trail integration
2. Source coverage reporting indicating which source types contributed data for each pharmaceutical category
3. Real-time collection metrics integrated with monitoring from Epic 1.6: APIs queried, sources found, data volume, costs
4. Quality indicators: source priority distribution, temperature variation coverage, duplicate detection with audit trails
5. Alert system for collection failures, quota exhaustion, or quality threshold violations
6. Collection completion notifications enabling downstream processing with audit trail linkage
7. Historical collection performance tracking supporting pharmaceutical operational optimization and compliance reporting

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create collection progress API endpoints (AC: 1)
- [x] Build source coverage reporting (AC: 2)
- [x] Implement real-time collection metrics (AC: 3)
- [x] Add quality indicators and scoring (AC: 4)
- [x] Configure alert system for collection issues (AC: 5)
- [x] Implement completion notifications (AC: 6)
- [x] Build historical performance tracking (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Depends on all Epic 2 stories for complete data collection monitoring capabilities.

### Collection Metrics Schema
```python
class CollectionMetrics(BaseModel):
    request_id: str
    total_categories: int
    completed_categories: int
    apis_queried: Dict[str, int]
    sources_found: int
    data_volume_mb: float
    total_cost: float
    quality_score: float
    completion_percentage: float
```

## Testing
Test real-time metrics accuracy, alert triggering, and historical performance tracking.
