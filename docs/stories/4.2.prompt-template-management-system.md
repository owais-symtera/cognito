Completed

## Story
**As a** Pharmaceutical Intelligence Specialist,
**I want** advanced prompt template management with pharmaceutical domain optimization,
**so that** pharmaceutical intelligence queries can be continuously optimized based on evolving industry needs and regulatory requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Prompt template database storage expanding basic templates from Epic 1.3 with version control and audit trails
2. Template editor interface for pharmaceutical domain experts with validation and testing capabilities
3. Template validation ensuring pharmaceutical parameters, regulatory compliance, and formatting requirements
4. A/B testing framework comparing prompt template effectiveness on pharmaceutical data quality with audit documentation
5. Template inheritance and customization supporting pharmaceutical category-specific variations with audit trails
6. Template approval workflow requiring pharmaceutical expert review with regulatory compliance documentation
7. Template performance metrics tracking pharmaceutical data quality and completeness results per template version

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build prompt template database with version control (AC: 1)
- [x] Create template editor interface with validation (AC: 2)
- [x] Implement template validation for pharmaceutical requirements (AC: 3)
- [x] Add A/B testing framework for template effectiveness (AC: 4)
- [x] Create template inheritance and customization system (AC: 5)
- [x] Implement template approval workflow (AC: 6)
- [x] Build template performance metrics tracking (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Extends Epic 1.3 basic template system with advanced management capabilities. Integrates with pharmaceutical domain expertise and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Template Management Structure
```python
class PromptTemplate:
    def __init__(self, category, version, approval_status):
        self.category = category
        self.version = version
        self.approval_status = approval_status
        self.performance_metrics = {}
        self.audit_trail = []
```

## Testing
Test template editor functionality, A/B testing accuracy, approval workflow, and performance metrics calculation.
