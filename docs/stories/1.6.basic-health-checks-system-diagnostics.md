## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Depends on all previous Epic 1 stories for complete system foundation including infrastructure, database, categories, API, and status tracking.

### Health Check Implementation [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
**FastAPI Health Endpoints**:
```python
# apps/backend/src/api/v1/health.py
@router.get("/health", response_model=HealthResponse)
async def basic_health_check():
    """Basic service health check"""
    return HealthResponse(
        status="healthy",
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
        version="1.0.0"
    )

@router.get("/health/detailed", response_model=DetailedHealthResponse)
async def detailed_health_check(
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    redis: Redis = Depends(get_redis)
):
    """Comprehensive health check with dependencies"""
    health_checks = await run_all_health_checks(db, redis)
    return DetailedHealthResponse(
        status=calculate_overall_status(health_checks),
        checks=health_checks,
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
    )
```

### System Diagnostics Schema
```python
class SystemDiagnosticsResponse(BaseModel):
    active_requests: int
    processing_queue_depth: int
    database_connections: ConnectionPoolStatus
    redis_status: RedisStatus
    worker_status: WorkerStatus
    memory_usage: MemoryUsage
    performance_metrics: PerformanceMetrics

    class ConnectionPoolStatus(BaseModel):
        active: int
        idle: int
        total_capacity: int
        utilization_percentage: float

    class PerformanceMetrics(BaseModel):
        avg_api_response_time_ms: float
        avg_db_query_time_ms: float
        requests_per_minute: float
        cache_hit_rate: float
```

### Structured Logging Configuration [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-logging.md]
**Pharmaceutical Compliance Logging**:
```python
# apps/backend/src/config/logging.py
class PharmaceuticalLogger:
    def log_processing_start(self, request_id: str, drug_name: str):
        self.logger.info(
            "pharmaceutical_processing_started",
            request_id=request_id,
            drug_name=drug_name,
            event_type="processing_start",
            compliance_level="regulatory"
        )

    def log_system_health_check(self, component: str, status: str):
        self.logger.info(
            "system_health_check",
            component=component,
            status=status,
            event_type="health_monitoring",
            compliance_level="operational"
        )
```

### External API Health Checks
**API Provider Health Validation**:
```python
async def check_api_providers_health():
    """Check health of all external API providers"""
    providers = ["chatgpt", "perplexity", "grok", "gemini", "tavily"]
    health_results = {}

    for provider in providers:
        try:
            response_time = await test_provider_connection(provider)
            health_results[provider] = {
                "status": "healthy",
                "response_time_ms": response_time,
                "last_check": datetime.utcnow()
            }
        except Exception as e:
            health_results[provider] = {
                "status": "unhealthy",
                "error": str(e),
                "last_check": datetime.utcnow()
            }

    return health_results
```
