2. Authentication framework supporting enterprise SSO, OAuth, API key management with pharmaceutical compliance documentation
3. Data format transformation supporting pharmaceutical industry standard formats with audit trail of transformation processes
4. Integration monitoring with connection health tracking, automatic reconnection, and pharmaceutical compliance reporting
5. Rate limiting and throttling respecting pharmaceutical enterprise system constraints with audit trail documentation
6. Integration testing framework validating pharmaceutical data flow end-to-end with regulatory compliance verification
7. Integration documentation and setup guides for pharmaceutical IT teams with audit trail of configuration changes

## Dev Notes
Depends on Story 6.1 for reliable webhook delivery foundation. Provides enterprise-grade integration capabilities for pharmaceutical business systems with comprehensive audit compliance.

### Enterprise Integration Framework
```python
class EnterpriseIntegration:
    SUPPORTED_SYSTEMS = {
        'salesforce': SalesforceConnector,
        'sap': SAPConnector,
        'veeva_crm': VeevaConnector,
        'oracle': OracleConnector
    }

    def create_integration(system_type, config, audit_requirements):
        # Initialize connector
        # Configure authentication
        # Set up monitoring
        # Document configuration
        return integration_instance, audit_record
```

## Testing
Test integration templates functionality, authentication mechanisms, data transformation accuracy, and monitoring effectiveness.
